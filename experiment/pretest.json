      "question": "What is the primary purpose of sand casting? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase the weight of the casting",
        "b": "To create hollow sections in the casting",
        "c": "To improve the strength of the mould",
        "d": "To enhance the surface finish of the casting"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A core is a sand structure placed inside the mould cavity to block certain areas from being filled with molten metal. This allows for hollow sections, internal channels, or complex shapes in the final casting. Cores ensure that the desired internal geometries are formed accurately without requiring post-processing like drilling or machining.",

      "question": "What happens to the core after the casting process is complete? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It becomes a permanent part of the casting",
        "b": "It is melted along with the metal",
        "c": "It is removed or broken away",
        "d": "It expands to fill the cavity"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cores are temporary structures that are designed to be removed after solidification. Once the metal has cooled and the mould is broken apart, the core is shaken out or chemically dissolved to reveal the hollow section inside the casting. If the core material is not collapsible, it could get trapped, leading to defects in the final product.",

      "question": " What is the purpose of ramming the core sand into the core box? (LO3)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To mix the sand with the binder",
        "b": "To ensure proper compaction and shape formation",
        "c": "To dry the core faster",
        "d": "To increase the cooling rate of molten metal"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ramming (compaction) is essential in core making to achieve uniform density and dimensional accuracy. Proper compaction prevents air pockets and weak spots, which could cause core breakage or deformation during casting. If the core sand is not compacted properly, it can lead to defects such as shrinkage cavities, cracks, or surface roughness in the final casting.",

      "question": ". Why is a hole made in the core during core preparation? (LO3)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To allow gases to escape during casting",
        "b": "To reduce the weight of the core",
        "c": "To improve surface finish",
        "d": "To increase the density of the core"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A vent hole (or gas passage) in the core is necessary to release trapped gases generated during the casting process. If gases do not escape, they can cause porosity, blowholes, or gas inclusions, leading to weak or defective castings. Proper venting also improves metal flow and ensures a smooth solidification process.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "Pouring the molten metal into the mould",

        "d": "Cooling the casting"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "After the core is compacted and hardened, the last step is to remove it from the core box without damaging its shape. This process requires gentle ramming or vibration to loosen the core. The core is then stored or dried further before being placed into the mould cavity for casting.",
