      "question": "Thermo-setting resin is used in core making process because:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It imparts high strength",
        "b": "It imparts collapsibility to core sand",
        "c": "It emits a minimum amount of mould and core gases",
        "d": "All the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "It imparts high strength to the core.",
        "b": "It imparts collapsibility to the core sand, allowing the core to break down easily during metal casting.",
        "c": "It emits a minimum amount of mold and core gases, which is beneficial for reducing defects in the casting.",

        "a": "Core prints are added to the pattern, core, or Mould to locate and support the core within the Mould cavity during the casting process. They provide a means to position the core accurately and ensure it remains in place until the molten metal solidifies.",
        "b": "Core prints are added to the pattern, core, or Mould to locate and support the core within the Mould cavity during the casting process.",
        "c": "Core prints are added to the pattern, core, or Mould to locate and support the core within the Mould cavity during the casting process.",
